Programming Exercises
22. Write a program to calculate the area of one
of the geometric figuresâ€”circle, rectangle or a
triangle. Write a function to calculate the area.
The function must receive one parameter which
is a structure that contains the type of figure and
the size of the components needed to calculate the
area must be a part of a union. Note that a circle
requires just one component, rectangle requires
two components and a triangle requires the size
of three components to calculate the area.
