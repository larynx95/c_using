Programming Exercises
13. Define a structure date containing three integersâ€”
day, month, and year. Write a program using
functions to read data, to validate the date entered
by the user and then print the date on the screen.
For example, if you enter 29,2,2010 then that is an
invalid date as 2010 is not a leap year. Similarly
31,6,2007 is invalid as June does not have 31 days.
